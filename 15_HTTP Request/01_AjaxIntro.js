/* 
AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript And XML/JSON

The idea of AJAX is using request we can make via javaScript Asynchronously to load or send data from a server. We communicate with the server behind the scenes instead of reloading the entire page. The request is sent based off a keyboard event.  The response is in JSON format. JSON is a format for sending data.
